### ✏️ Available as a Docs-Only Typo-Fix Collaborator  
Even small typo fixes can take up valuable time for maintainers—I completely understand that.  
If your project could use some help cleaning up documentation or comments, I'd be happy to support.

So far, I’ve been contributing on a PR basis proactively,  
but I'd also be open to helping more consistently—  
for example, as a **docs-only collaborator focused on typo corrections and minor language improvements**.

Of course, I understand that collaborator access comes with a level of trust.  
If there’s something specific you’d like me to take a look at, feel free to mention me on GitHub,  
and I’ll gladly review it. Please feel free to reach out anytime!

🔍 **Insights from 13 typo cases:**  
- **Types of mistakes**  
  - Incorrect articles (e.g., `a` → `an`, `an` → `a`, `a the` → `the`): **5 cases (38.5%)**  
  - Spelling errors (e.g., `practicies` → `practices`, `intialize` → `initialize`, `disabeling` → `disabling`, `Replaceed` → `Replaced`, `them` → `then`): **5 cases (38.5%)**  
  - Subject-verb agreement (e.g., `Committers comes` → `Committers come`): **1 case (7.7%)**  
  - Pronoun misuse (e.g., `them` → `it`): **1 case (7.7%)**  
  - Capitalization inconsistency (e.g., `Geodjango` → `GeoDjango`): **1 case (7.7%)**

- **Where typos appeared**  
  - Markdown files (README, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTORS.md, CHANGELOG.md): **4 cases (30.8%)**  
  - TypeScript files (tests, compatibility code): **3 cases (23.1%)**  
  - Python files (comments, docstrings, test files): **3 cases (23.1%)**  
  - JavaScript files (plugin logic): **1 case (7.7%)**  
  - YAML config files: **1 case (7.7%)**  
  - Test scripts (GeoDjango-specific): **1 case (7.7%)**

🧠 Initially, I assumed that spelling errors would be the most common type of typo.  
However, it turns out that **incorrect articles (a/an/the)** were the most frequent.  
These subtle grammatical mistakes often **slip through standard Linters and CI checks**,  
so I'm interested in researching this area further—and hopefully building tools to help catch these kinds of issues.  
Also, I’ve noticed that **spelling errors often occur in words that contain the letter “i”**—this might be an interesting pattern worth exploring!

💡 Analyzing these patterns can help improve review and CI processes.  
Next, I’m planning to take on flaky test fixes and contribute more actively.
