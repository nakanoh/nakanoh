### 👋 Working towards becoming an OSS contributor  
Started by fixing typos and learning how to contribute step by step.

🔹 **Typo Fixes – PRs merged to:**

🔍 **Insights from 5 typo fixes:**  
- **Types of mistakes**  
  - Incorrect articles (e.g. `a` → `an`　 `a the` → `the`): 3 cases (60%)  
  - Spelling errors (e.g. `practicies` → `practices`): 1 case (20%)  
  - Pronoun misuse (e.g. `them` → `it`): 1 case (20%)

- **Where typos appeared**  
  - Markdown files (README, SECURITY.md): 2 cases (40%)  
  - TypeScript files (tests, compat code): 2 cases (40%)  
  - Python files (comments, docstrings): 1 case (20%)

💡 Analyzing these patterns helps improve review and CI practices.  
Next, I'm planning to take on flaky test fixes and contribute more actively.
